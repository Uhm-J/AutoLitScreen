- The study must explicitly mention the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) in cells, tissues, or organisms.
- The study examines molecules/compounds (small molecules, biologics, antibodies, peptides, etc.) that bind to or interact with TSHR.
- These compounds must be distinct from the receptorâ€™s natural ligand (TSH).
- The study reports or measures cAMP levels, intracellular signaling changes, or functional outcomes relevant to cAMP production downstream of TSHR.
- The article presents new data, insights, or a review of existing data specifically addressing such TSHR interactions and cAMP effects.
