24794233: Here’s the breakdown of the text, identifying the specific small molecule drug names/chemical compound names that interact with TSHR and affect cAMP production, as per the research question.
24794233: **Specific Molecule Names:**
24794233: *   Tg-Abs (Thyrogloublin autoantibodies)
24794233: *   TPO-Abs (Thyroperoxidase autoantibodies)
24794233: *   TSHR-Abs (Autoantibodies against the thyrotropin receptor)
24794233: *   β-adrenergic agonists (Implied through the reference to the increase in cAMP) - *Note: While not explicitly named, the context strongly suggests this given the effect on TSHR.*
24794233: **Explanation of Why Other Terms Were Excluded:**
24794233: *   **TSH (Thyrotropin):** This is a *protein* hormone, not a small molecule drug/compound.
24794233: *   **Proteins:** As a category, proteins were excluded.
24794233: *   **Genes:** These are genetic sequences, not chemical compounds.
24794233: *   **Salts, Ions:** These are chemical formulas, not specific molecules.
24794233: *   **General Chemical Classes** (e.g., “adrenergic agonists”) -  The question requires *specific* compounds.
24794233: **Important Note:** The provided text focuses heavily on the *measurement* of cAMP elevation in the context of thyroid disease and the role of autoantibodies. It doesn't list specific chemical drugs that are actively being administered to *cause* this change.
